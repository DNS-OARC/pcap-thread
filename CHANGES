    b475589 Use -Wall when compiling, fix a few warnings and a oops in
            `pcap_thread_stop()`

    Release 1.0.0

    First version with basic pthreads support and fallback to `select()`
    on pcaps file descriptors in non-blocking mode.  Three different queue
    modes exists for threaded mode when processing packets; `cond` which
    uses pthread conditions, `wait` which uses `select()` to unconditionally
    wait a while and `yield` which uses `sched_yield()` (if supported) if
    there are no packets to process.

    The example program `hexdump` is included which is a "show and tell"
    of how to use pcap_thread.  The program is a simple `tcpdump` clone
    which will output packets in hexadecimal.
