    Release 1.1.1

    0a06702 Fix Coverity CID 143102 (#1 of 1): Buffer not null terminated

2016-08-25 Jerry Lundström

    Release 1.1.0

    New features:
    - `pcap_thread_next()`, will step through the pcaps and process
      one packet at a time starting with the first pcap open/add'ed
      and then looping around.
    - `pcap_thread_next_reset()`, resets the internal so that next
      call with `pcap_thread_next()` will start again with the first
      pcap open/add'ed.
    - `pcap_thread_timedrun()`/`pcap_thread_set_timedrun()` can be
      used to do a timed run which means that `pcap_thread_run()` will
      return a short while after the `struct timeval` time has passed.
    - New options to `hexdump`:
      `-A <secs>`          exit after a number of seconds
      `-c <count>`         process count packets then exit

    Bug/tweak fixes:
    - Fix behavior of the none threaded engine part of `pcap_thread_run()`,
      will end only after all pcaps are done.
    - Various error handling

    b475589 Use -Wall when compiling, fix a few warnings and a oops in
            `pcap_thread_stop()`

    Release 1.0.0

    First version with basic pthreads support and fallback to `select()`
    on pcaps file descriptors in non-blocking mode.  Three different queue
    modes exists for threaded mode when processing packets; `cond` which
    uses pthread conditions, `wait` which uses `select()` to unconditionally
    wait a while and `yield` which uses `sched_yield()` (if supported) if
    there are no packets to process.

    The example program `hexdump` is included which is a "show and tell"
    of how to use pcap_thread.  The program is a simple `tcpdump` clone
    which will output packets in hexadecimal.
