PCAP helper library with POSIX threads support and transport layer callbacks

## About

This is a helper library that will initialize the `pcap_t` for you and,
if you have support, launch a thread per `pcap_t` for the collection which
is then feeded back to the main thread using a queue before being passed on
to the callback.

Additional callbacks exists for simplifying the handling of various transport
layers, based on [pcap_layers](https://github.com/wessels/pcap_layers) by
Duane Wessels (The Measurement Factory, Inc.), such as ether, VLAN, IP, IPv4,
IPv6, GRE tunnels, UDP and TCP.

## Usage

Here is a short example how to use this helper, see the hexdump directory
for a more complete example.

```c
#include "config.h"
#include "pcap-thread/pcap_thread.h"

void callback(u_char* user, const struct pcap_pkthdr* packet_header, const u_char* packet, int datalink_type) {
    ...
}

int main(void) {
    pcap_thread_t pt = PCAP_THREAD_T_INIT;

    pcap_thread_set_snaplen(&pt, 65535);
    pcap_thread_set_filter(&pt, "port 80", 7);
    pcap_thread_set_callback(&pt, callback);
    pcap_thread_open(&pt, "eth0", 0);
    pcap_thread_open(&pt, "lo", 0);
    pcap_thread_run(&pt);
    pcap_thread_close(&pt);

    return 0;
}
```
